# Honeypot Lab

## Objective

The objective of this project was to deploy a honeypot using T-Pot on a cloud VM to capture and analyze cyber-attacks in real time. By integrating multiple honeypots into a single environment, this project aimed to provide hands-on experience in detecting, visualizing, and analyzing network attacks using tools like Kibana and Spiderfoot.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in deploying and managing honeypots.
- Real-time attack monitoring and analysis.
- Data visualization and querying using Kibana.
- Network traffic analysis and reporting.
- Incident detection through honeypot integration.

### Tools Used

- T-Pot: Honeypot deployment platform.
- Digital Ocean: Cloud server for hosting the honeypot.
- Kibana: Data visualization and log analysis.
- SecurityMeter: Tool for measuring the security posture and detecting vulnerabilities.
- SpiderFoot: OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) for threat intelligence gathering.
